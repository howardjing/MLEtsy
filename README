DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR,

JAVA
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE:
control: 
	- Ranker: the main class for finding preferences
	- Helper: contains static functions that handle the math computation stuff

For storing Etsy data:
representation:
	- User: a collection of items favorited by a user
	- RandomItems: a collection of random items
	- Item: a collection of tags that describe an Etsy item
	- Items: the superclass of User and RandomItems, an abstract class

Misc:
	- RandomData: generates random items distributed as a gaussian
	- WordleTextGenerator: prints a user's data to the console so we can get pretty wordle pictures.

CV stuff
	- Karen's copy and pasted code


OBJECTIVE C
	- Shirmung's stuff

R
Plotting
- GaussianPlot: plots a bunch of gaussian distributions, will work on this when we get to the presentation
