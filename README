recommending items to Etsy user

***** IMPORTANT *****
RankRandomItems.sh is what we're gonna use to rank items given a text file of user items and a text file of random items
usage: ./RankRandomItems.sh [pathToUserItems] [pathToRandomItems] [pathToSavedFile]
ie:    ./RankRandomItems.sh data/MadeUpTrainingData.txt data/MadeUpTestingData.txt output/results.txt
Note that if with 4000 user items and 5000 random items, it takes around 4 minutes to run on my computer.


*** Can probably ignore this part ***
To compile FirstRun.java
javac -sourcepath src -d classes src/FirstRun.java

To run FirstRun.java
java -Xmx2048m -classpath classes FirstRun

*** It would be nice if you read the rest of this though ***
The -Xmx2048m is to set the max heap size to 2048 mb, since it looks like our hashmaps take a lot of room
FirstRun takes around 4 min to run on my computer.

DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR,

JAVA
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE:
control: 
	- Ranker: the main class for finding preferences
	- Helper: contains static functions that handle the math computation stuff

For storing Etsy data:
representation:
	- User: a collection of items favorited by a user
	- RandomItems: a collection of random items
	- Item: a collection of tags that describe an Etsy item
	- Items: the superclass of User and RandomItems, an abstract class

Misc:
	- RandomData: generates random items distributed as a gaussian
	- WordleTextGenerator: prints a user's data to the console so we can get pretty wordle pictures.

CV stuff
	- Karen's copy and pasted code (jkjkjkjk)


OBJECTIVE C
	- Shirmung's stuff

R
Plotting
	- GaussianPlot: plots a bunch of gaussian distributions, will work on this when we get to the presentation
