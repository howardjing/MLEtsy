recommending items to Etsy user

To compile FirstRun.java
javac -sourcepath src -d classes src/FirstRun.java

To run FirstRun.java
java -classpath classes FirstRun


DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR, I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE SO PLEASE WRITE A SHORT DESCRIPTION
WE REALLY HAVE TO ORGANIZE THE WAY OUR JAVA FILES ARE SET UP BTW ITS KIND OF GROSS

JAVA
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE:
control: 
	- Ranker: the main class for finding preferences, should probably be renamed to something more descriptive
	- Helper: contains static functions that handle the math computation stuff

For storing Etsy data:
representation:
	- User: a collection of items favorited by a user
	- RandomItems: a collection of random items
	- Item: a collection of tags that describe an Etsy item
	- Items: the superclass of User and RandomItems, an abstract class

Misc:
	- RandomData: generates random items distributed as a gaussian
	- WordleTextGenerator: prints a user's data to the console so we can get pretty wordle pictures.

CV stuff???


OBJECTIVE C
Querying stuff????

R
Plotting
- GuassianPlot: plots a bunch of gaussian distributions, will work on this when we get to the presentation
