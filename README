recommending items to Etsy user

DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR, I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE SO PLEASE WRITE A SHORT DESCRIPTION
WE REALLY HAVE TO ORGANIZE THE WAY OUR JAVA FILES ARE SET UP BTW ITS KIND OF GROSS

JAVA
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE:
- Tester: the main class for finding preferences, should probably be renamed to something more descriptive

For storing Etsy data:
- User: a collection of items favorited by a user
- RandomItems: a collection of random items
- Item: a collection of tags that describe an Etsy item
- Items: the superclass of User and RandomItems, an abstract class

Misc:
- Helper: contains static functions that handle the math computation stuff
- RandomData: generates random items distributed as a gaussian
- WordleTextGenerator: prints a user's data to the console so we can get pretty wordle pictures.

CV stuff???


OBJECTIVE C
Querying stuff????

R
Plotting
- GuassianPlot: plots a bunch of gaussian distributions, will work on this when we get to the presentation
